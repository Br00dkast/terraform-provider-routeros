## Schema

### Required

- `bridge` (String) The bridge interface where MLAG is being created.
- `peer_port` (String) An interface that will be used as a peer port. Both peer devices are using inter-chassis communication over these peer ports to establish MLAG and update the host table. Peer port should be isolated on a different untagged VLAN using a pvid setting. Peer port can be configured as a bonding interface.

### Optional

- `heartbeat` (String) This setting controls how often heartbeat messages are sent to check the connection between peers. If no heartbeat message is received for three intervals in a row, the peer logs a warning about potential communication problems. If set to none, heartbeat messages are not sent at all.
- `priority` (Number) This setting changes the priority for selecting the primary MLAG node. A lower number means higher priority. If both MLAG nodes have the same priority, the one with the lowest bridge MAC address will become the primary device.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import
Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
terraform import routeros_bridge_mlag.mlag .
